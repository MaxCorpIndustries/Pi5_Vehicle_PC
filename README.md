This repo contains the code meant for the custom dash screen meant for the 04 civic. 

This system should include the following features as the MVP:
- Working multi camera recording (similar to how a tesla has POV shots from the self driving cameras around the vehicle)
- Working statistics information from the EV Hybrid system and the ICE engine (maybe via speeduino configuration)
- Working screen output of the camera system
- Working aux or bluetooth integration with the phone
